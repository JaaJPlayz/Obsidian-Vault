## What is Bootstrap?

Bootstrap is a free and open-source front-end framework used for developing responsive and mobile-first websites. It contains CSS- and JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components. Bootstrap was originally developed by **Mark Otto** and **Jacob Thornton** at Twitter and released in 2011.

### Key Features of Bootstrap:
- **Mobile-First**: Bootstrap is designed with a mobile-first approach, meaning it's optimized for mobile devices and can scale up for desktop users.

- **Customizable**: Developers can modify Bootstrapâ€™s default theme and components to match the design needs of their project.
- **Pre-built Components**: It offers many ready-to-use components such as navigation bars, dropdowns, alerts, modals, and more.

## Core Components

### 1. **Grid System**
Bootstrap's grid system allows up to 12 columns across the page. This system is built with a flexbox layout, making it flexible and adaptive to various screen sizes. It allows the easy alignment of content in rows and columns.

- **Columns**: 12 equal-width columns.
- **Breakpoints**: Bootstrap's grid system is responsive, and it offers breakpoints at different screen widths like:
  - `xs` (Extra small devices)
  - `sm` (Small devices)
  - `md` (Medium devices)
  - `lg` (Large devices)
  - `xl` (Extra-large devices)

### 2. **CSS Components**
Bootstrap provides a variety of CSS components to style elements quickly and easily:
- **Typography**: Pre-defined classes for styling headings, paragraphs, lists, etc.
- **Forms**: Easily style and manage forms with input groups, checkboxes, radios, etc.
- **Buttons**: Multiple styles, sizes, and colors of buttons.
- **Tables**: Styled tables with built-in responsiveness and customization.

### 3. **JavaScript Components**
Bootstrap comes with several JavaScript-powered components that enhance interactivity:
- **Modals**: Lightboxes and dialog windows for additional content without reloading the page.
- **Dropdowns**: Interactive dropdown menus for navigation or options.
- **Carousels**: Image or content sliders.
- **Tooltips**: Hover-over popups to display additional information.
