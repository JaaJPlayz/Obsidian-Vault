### Summary Tips for Securing Ports:

- **Firewall**: Use firewalls to restrict access to only necessary ports.
- **Encryption**: Always prefer encrypted protocols (e.g., SSH over Telnet, HTTPS over HTTP).
- **Updates**: Regularly patch services to prevent vulnerabilities.
- **Authentication**: Use strong passwords, public key authentication, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) where possible.
- **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor network traffic for unusual activity.
